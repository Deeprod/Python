Some of the best films of all time are those whose different strengths
all work in concert to create a unified, engrossing whole. The Shining,
The Social Network, and Jaws are all excellent examples of films made up
of strong individual parts complementing each other to form a fantastic
work of art. That is absolutely true of God of War - its musical score
elevates story moments, which flow seamlessly into fantastic action gameplay,
which facilitates exploration and puzzles that reward you with a deeper
understanding of its characters and its expansive and beautiful world.
God of War is a masterful composition of exceptional interlocking parts,
deliberate in its design and its foreshadowing,
which pays off in unexpected ways in both the gameplay and story.
