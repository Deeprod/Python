The [b] Peanut Butter Falcon [bb] [u]is an[uu] [i]adventure[ii] [[C:\Users\Jonathan\Google Drive\Website\_Website_Test_Doc\soup]] set in the [[world]] of a modern Mark Twain that begins when Zak (22), a young man with Down syndrome, runs away from the nursing home where he lives to chase his dream of becoming a professional wrestler by attending the wrestling school The Salt Water Redneck. Through circumstances beyond their control Tyler (32), a small-time outlaw on the run, becomes Zak's unlikely coach and ally. Together they wind through deltas, elude capture, drink whisky, find God, catch fish, and convince Eleanor (28), a kind nursing home employee with a story of her own, to join them on their journey.
